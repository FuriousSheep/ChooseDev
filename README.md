This is a basic, beginner-made haskell program.

Compile it with `$ ghc chooseNext.hs -o chooseNext`

Use `$ ./chooseNext` to get instructions on how to use the program

Example uses:

`$ ./chooseNext Damian Otis SuperBurgerPants`
`$ ./chooseNext myDevFile.txt`

If you use a dev file, use the format given in devs-example.txt

Have fun! Or not! This is about work! But you never know!
